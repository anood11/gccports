The operations were planned well ahead and all concerned parties performed flawlessly in turning around the flight.  Xiamen saw its first 747-8 service on 1 February when the Cargolux aircraft arrived from Beijing. On 3 February, Cargolux performed the inaugural 747-8 service to South America with a flight to Latacunga. Previously, the southernmost destination of any 747-8 operator was Panama City. The return flight also touched down in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico - another first that Cargolux achieved. The approval by local authorities, that cleared Aguadilla airport for 747-8 operations, was the final hurdle that allows Cargolux to operate the 747-8 in South America for the first time. It was achieved with the cooperation of Cargolux, Boeing, the Aguadilla Airport Authority, the Puerto Rico Port Authority and the Federal Aviation Administration. Brazil remains one of the last countries in Cargolux’s network that still has not approved its airports for 747-8 operations, a situation that remains a challenge for the Luxembourg carrier that is still limited to 747-400F services in the region.  70 Cargolux destinations are now cleared for 747-8F operations; Vietnam is expected to approve its airports in the near future. This will enable Cargolux to use its new freighter almost throughout its entire network.  Boeing’s 747-8F is the most advanced freighter aircraft in its class and gives Cargolux an aircraft that sets new benchmarks in economic and environmental performance. The company currently operates six of the new freighters and expects additional deliveries throughout 2013.', '2013-02-19', '23:02:02', '1', 1),

Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem said, was made possible by the high level of support the company has received from Dubai’s leadership, loyal customers, stakeholders and committed employees.  The 100 million TEU record was achieved between January 2003 and January 2013 and covers all container boxes handled in both Mina Rashid and Jebel Ali Port. DP World, UAE Region’s annual container throughput increased more than 150% over the decade, from around five million TEU in 2003 to 13.3 million TEU in 2012.  In all, the two container ports have handled 135 million TEU since the opening of Jebel Ali Port in 1979, around 75% of it since 2003.  In a recognition of the crucial roles they have played in DP World’s success story, members of the DP World Alumni Network were invited as special guests to celebrations at Jebel Ali Port where the Chairman unveiled a container box painted in company colours, in the presence of senior officials, including Vice Chairman H.E. Jamal Majid Bin Thaniah, Group Chief Executive Officer Mohammed Sharaf, and Senior Vice President and Managing Director of DP World, UAE Region Mohammed Al Muallem – all of whom have played pivotal leadership roles in the company’s emergence as the third largest global marine terminal operator.  The expansion work currently underway at Jebel Ali includes adding 1 million TEU in new capacity to Container Terminal 2 (T2) during the first half of this year and the development of a 4 million TEU capacity mega Container Terminal 3 (T3) by 2014. When the expansion work is complete, Jebel Ali Port will be able to handle ten of the next generation 18,000 TEU mega vessels at the same time – the only port in the region able to do so. Dubai’s modern port industry goes back to 1969 when the late Ruler, Sheikh Rashid Bin Saeed Al Maktoum gave instructions for a four-berth deep-water harbour to be constructed close to the mouth of Dubai Creek. By 1978, with a capacity of 1,500,000 TEU, the number of berths at Mina Rashid was increased to 35.  Encouraged by the market’s response, Sheikh Rashid launched an even more ambitious project. When opened in 1979, Jebel Ali Port was ranked the world’s largest man-made harbour.  In May 1991, Dubai Ports Authority (DPA) was established to manage both Mina Rashid and Jebel Ali Port. The merger led to a dramatic increase in throughput, exceeding one million TEU per annum for the first time. DPA and DPI was merged in 2005 to form DP World.In 2007, DP World, UAE Region achieved the throughput of 10,000,000 TEU in a single year. After a few months, container and general cargo operations at Mina Rashid were shifted to Jebel Ali Port, the gateway to a market of more than 2 billion people.  For well over a year now, DP World, UAE Region has been handling volumes of more than 1 million TEU every month. In 2012 DP World, UAE Region handled 13.3 million TEU.', '2013-02-17', NULL, '1', 1),

The vessel is the last in a series of seven units and is owned by Stena Bulk. The Stena Sunrise is a third generation, fuel-efficient Suezmax and, like the other tankers in the series, will be employed on the spot market via Stena Sonangol Suezmax Pool. She was delivered on 30 January and will sail with a cargo of gas oil from Asia to Europe. A number of international guests had gathered together with representatives of SHI and the Stena Group at the shipyard in Geoje to attend the naming ceremony. The Stena Sunrise’s godmother was Inge Widjaja, married to Franky O Widjaja, owner of Indonesian Golden Agri (GAR).  The Stena Sunrise is the last vessel in a series built at SHI and ordered at the beginning of 2010. “The seven sisters”, each representing an investment of just under SEK 500 million, were projected by Stena Bulk. The seven sister ships, all of which have now been delivered, are the Stena Superior (owned by Stena Bulk), theStena Suède (Stena Bulk), theMontesperanza (Spanish Ibaizabal Tankers), the MonteStena (Ibaizabal Tankers), the Stena Supreme (Concordia Maritime), the AST Sunshine (joint venture between Japanese Asahi Tankers and Stena Bulk) and the Stena Sunrise(Stena Bulk).  Together with SHI, Stena Teknik has been responsible for the development of the new ship model, where the focus has been on energy efficiency. The vessel’s technical equipment and design mean that fuel consumption can be reduced by up to 10-15 percent compared with standard tonnage. As a result, fuel consumption can be reduced by 4-6 thousand litres per day thus saving USD 3-4,000/day.  “Like Stena Teknik, we are very satisfied with the collaboration with the Samsung shipyard, which has characterised both the development and production of this tanker series. Besides the generally good quality delivered by the shipyard, we have together achieved our fuel efficiency target, which was the single most important objective”, says Erik Hånell, President and CEO of Stena Bulk, in a comment.
