<span style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: underline">General Types of 
Ships</span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
<b><u><font size="2">Cargo Ship</font></u></b><font size="2"><br>
A cargo ship or freighter is any sort of ship or vessel that carries cargo, goods, and materials from one port to another. Thousands of cargo carriers ply the world's seas and oceans each year; they handle the bulk of international trade. Cargo ships are usually specially designed for the task, often being equipped with cranes and other mechanisms to load and unload, and come in all sizes. Today, they are almost always built of welded steel, and with some exceptions generally have a life expectancy of 25 to 30 years before being scrapped. <br><br>

<b><u>Container Ship</u></b><br>
Container ships are cargo ships that carry all of their load in truck-size containers, in technique called containerisation. They form a common means of commercial intermodel freight transport. <br><br>

<b><u>Bulk Carrier</u></b><br>
A bulk carrier, bulk freighter, or bulker is a merchant ship used to transport unpackaged bulk cargo such as cereals, coal, ore, and cement. Ships recognizable as bulk carriers began to appear in the mid-19th century and have steadily grown in sophistication. Today, bulkers make up a third of the world's merchant fleet and range from small coastal trading vessels of under 500 deadweight tons (DWT) to mammoths of 365,000 DWT. <br><br>

<b><u>Reefer (Ship) </u></b><br>
The reefer is a type of ship typically used to transport perishable commodities which require temperature-controlled transportation, mostly fruits, meat, fish, vegetables, dairy products and other foodstuffs. Reeferships may be split into two categories: (1) Sidedoor vessels have sidedoors that are lowered to the quay and serve as loading and discharging ramps for the forklifts. In the rear of the sidedoor there is a double pallet elevator, which brings the cargo to the respective decks. This special design makes the vessels particularly well suited for short distance trade. (2) Conventional vessels have a traditional cargo operation with hatches and cranes/derricks well suited for the handling of palletized and loose cargo. <br><br>

<b><u>Roll-on/Roll-off </u></b><br>
Roll-on/roll-off (RORO or ro-ro) ships are designed to carry wheeled cargo such as automobiles, trailers or railroad cars. This is in contrast to lo-lo (lift on-lift off) vessels which use a crane to load and unload cargo. RORO vessels have built-in ramps which allow the cargo to be efficiently "rolled on" and "rolled off" the vessel when in port. While smaller ferries that operate across rivers and other short distances still often have built-in ramps, the term RORO is generally reserved for larger ocean-going. vessels. <br><br>

<b><u>Tanker (Ship) </u></b><br>
A tanker is a ship designed to transport liquids in bulk. Petroleum tankers are a particular brand of tanker all their own.Tankers can range in size of capacity from several hundred tons, which includes vessels for servicing small harbours and coastal settlements, to several hundred thousand tons, for long-range haulage. <br><br>

<b><u>Petroleum Tanker</u></b><br>
Petroleum tankers, also known as oil tankers, tankers, or oilers, are ships of varying sizes designed for the bulk transport of petroleum. The largest are up to 650,000 tons. Since the creation of the first oil tanker back in 1878, crude oil has normally been transported by ship from near the point of extraction closer to consuming markets where the crude oil is then refined into a variety of products or materials used in further manufacture. Tankers can roughly be divided into two types - naval and merchant - and these can be divided into further subtypes. <br><br>

<b><u>Chemical Tanker</u></b><br>
A chemical tanker is a type of tanker designed to transport chemicals in bulk. Ocean-going chemical tankers generally range from 5,000 to 40,000 dwt in size, which is considerably smaller than the average size of other tanker types due to the specialised nature of their cargoes and the size restrictions of the port terminals where they call to load and discharge. Chemical tankers normally have a series of separate cargo tanks which are either coated with specialised coatings such as phenolic epoxy or zinc paint, or made from stainless steel. The coating or cargo tank material determines what types of cargo a particular tank can carry: stainless steel tanks are required for aggressive acid cargoes such as sulphuric and phosphoric acid, while 'easier' cargoes - e.g. vegetable oil - can be carried in epoxy coated tanks. <br><br>

<b><u>LNG Carrier</u></b><br>
LNG carrier is a ship designed for transporting liquefied natural gas (LNG). As the LNG market is growing rapidly also the fleet of LNG carriers is in a tremendous growth at the moment.<br><br>
<b><u>Naval Ship</u></b><br>
A naval ship is a ship (or sometimes boat, depending on classification) used for combat purposes, commonly by a navy. Naval ships are differentiated from civilian ships by construction and purpose. Generally, naval ships are damage resilient and armed with various weapon systems, though armament on troop transports is light or non-existent. The term "warship" is usually used to identify the subclass of naval ships designed primarily as combatants, as opposed to support or yard operations.<br><br>


<b><u>Coastal Trading Vessel</u></b><br>
Coastal trading vessels, also known as coasters, are shallow-hulled ships used for trade between locations on the same island or continent. Their shallow hulls mean that they can get through reefs where sea-going ships usually cannot (sea-going ships have a very deep hull for supplies and trade etc.). <br><br>

<b><u>Passenger Ship</u></b><br>
A passenger ship is a ship whose primary function is to carry passengers. The category does not include cargo vessels which have accommodations for limited numbers of passengers, such as the ubiquitous twelve-passenger freighters once common on the seas in which the transport of passengers is secondary to the carriage of freight. The type does however include many classes of ships designed to transport substantial numbers of passengers as well as freight. Indeed, until recently virtually all ocean liners were able to transport mail, package freight and express, and other cargo in addition to passenger luggage, and were equipped with cargo holds and derricks, kingposts, or other cargo-handling gear for that purpose. Only in more recent ocean liners and in virtually all cruise ships has this cargo capacity been suppressed. While typically passenger ships are part of the merchant marine, passenger ships have also been used as troopships and often are commissioned as naval ships when used as for that purpose. <br><br>

<b><u>Cruise Ship</u></b><br>
A cruise ship or a cruise liner is a passenger ship used for pleasure voyages, where the voyage itself and the ship's amenities are considered an essential part of the experience. Cruising has become a major part of the tourism industry, with millions of passengers each year as of 2006. The industry's rapid growth has seen nine or more newly built ships catering to a North American clientele added every year since 2001, as well as others servicing European clientele. Smaller markets such as the Asia-Pacific region are generally serviced by older tonnage displaced by new ships introduced into the high growth areas. <br><br>

<b><u>Cruiseferry</u></b><br>
A cruiseferry is a ship that combines the features of a cruise ship with a Ro-Ro ferry. Many passengers travel with the ships for the cruise experience, staying only a few hours at the destination port or not leaving the ship at all, while as others use the ships as means of transportation. <br><br>

<b><u>Ferry</u></b><br>
A ferry is a form of transport, usually a boat or ship, but also other forms, carrying or ferrying passengers and sometimes their vehicles. Ferries are also used to transport freight (in lorries and sometimes unpowered freight containers) and even railroad cars. Most ferries operate on regular, frequent, return services. A foot-passenger ferry with many stops, such as in Venice, is sometimes called a water bus or water taxi. Ferries form a part of the public transport systems of many waterside cities and islands, allowing direct transit between points at a capital cost much lower than bridges or tunnels. <br><br>

<b><u>Cable Layer</u></b><br>
A cable layer is a deep-sea vessel designed and used to lay underwater cables for telecommunications, electricity, and such. A large superstructure, and one or more spools that feed off the transom distinguish it. <br><br>

<b><u>Tugboat</u></b><br>
A tugboat, or tug, is a boat used to maneuver, primarily by towing or pushing, other vessels (see shipping) in harbours, over the open sea or through rivers and canals. They are also used to tow barges, disabled ships, or other equipment like towboats. <br><br>

<b><u>Dredger</u></b><br>
Dredging is the repositioning of soil from a marine environment, using specialized equipment, in order to initiate infrastructural and/or ecological improvements. In this definition "repositioning" stands for the process of removal, transport, placement and often treatment of soil; "soil" stands for sediment or silt, as well as for specified soil types like sand, gravel and rock. <br><br>

<b><u>Barge</u></b><br>
A barge is a flat-bottomed boat, built mainly for river and canal transport of heavy goods. Most barges are not self-propelled and need to be moved by tugboats towing or towboats pushing them. Barges on canals (towed by draft animals on an adjacent towpath) contended with the railway in the early industrial revolution but were outcompeted in the carriage of high value items due to the higher speed, falling costs, and route flexibility of rail transport.<br><br>

<b><u>Seawaymax</u></b><br>
The term Seawaymax refers to vessels which are the maximum size that can fit through the canal locks of the St. Lawrence Seaway. Seawaymax vessels are 740 feet in length, 78 feet wide, (maximum 226 m length, 24 m beam) and have a draft of 26 feet (7.92 m). A number of Lake freighters larger than this size cruise the Great Lakes and cannot pass through to the Atlantic Ocean. The size of the locks limits the size of the ships which can pass and so limits the size of the cargoes they can carry. The record tonnage for one vessel on the Seaway is 28,502 tons of iron ore while the record through the larger locks of the Great Lakes Waterway is 72,351 tons. Most new lake vessels, however, are constructed to the Seawaymax limit to enhance versatility by allowing the possibility of off-Lakes use. <br><br>

<b><u>Handymax</u></b><br>Traditionally the workhorses of the dry bulk market, the Handy and more recent Handymax types remain popular ships with less than 60,000 dwt. The Handymax sector operates in a large number of geographically dispersed global trades, mainly carrying grains and minor bulks including steel products, forest products and fertilizers. The vessels are well suited for small ports with length and draft restrictions and also lacking transshipment infrastructure. This category is also used to define small-sized oil tankers. <br><br>

<b><u>Handysize</u></b><br>
Although there is no official definition in terms of exact tonnages, Handysize most usually refers to a dry bulk vessel (or, less commonly, to a product tanker) with deadweight of about 15,000–35,000 tons. Above this size are Handymax bulkers (typically 35,000 - 58,000 tons deadweight); there is no well-defined or widely accepted size sector below 15,000 tons. Handysize is numerically the most common size of bulk carrier, with nearly 2000 units in service totalling about 43 million tons. Handysize ships are very flexible because their size allows them to enter smaller ports, and in most cases they are 'geared' - i.e. fitted with cranes - which means that they can load and discharge cargoes at ports which lack cranes or other cargo handling systems. Compared to larger bulk carriers, handysizes carry a wider variety of cargo types. These include steel products, grain, metal ores, phosphate, cement, logs, woodchips and other types of so-called 'breakbulk' cargo. Handysize bulkers are built mainly by shipyards in Japan, Korea, China, the Philippines and India, though a few other countries also have the capacity to build such vessels. The most common industry-standard specification handysize bulker is now about 32,000 mt deadweight on a summer draft of about 10.0 metres, and features 5 cargo holds with hydraulically operated hatch covers, with four 30 metric ton cranes for cargo handling. Some handysizes are also fitted with stanchions to enable logs to be loaded in stacks on deck. Such vessels are often referred to as 'handy loggers'. <br><br>

<b><u>Malaccamax</u></b><br>
Malaccamax is a naval architecture term for the largest ships capable of fitting through the Straits of Malacca. The restriction is caused by the shallow point on the Strait, where minimum depth is 25 m, 5m deeper than the Sunda Strait's 20m maximum depth. A post malaccamax ship would need to circumnavigate Australia, use the Lombok Strait, or use the proposed yet-unbuilt Kra Canal. Bulk carriers and supertankers have been built to this size, and the term is chosen for very large crude carriers (VLCC). Not constructed yet but envisioned, a Malaccamax container ship would be 470 m long and 60 m wide, with 20 m of draft with a 300,000 DWT for 18,000 TEUs. The ports growth requirements could be leading to the creation of new terminals dedicated to those ships. <br><br>

<u>

<b>Panamax</b></u><br> Represents the largest acceptable size to transit the Panama Canal, which can be applied to both freighters and tankers; lengths are restricted to a maximum of 275 meters, and widths to slightly more than 32 meter. The average size of such a ship is about 65,000 dwt. They mainly carry coal, grain and, to a lesser extent, minor bulks, including steel products, forest products and fertilizers.

<u>

<b>Capesize</b></u><br>Refers to a rather ill-defined standard which have the common characteristic of being incapable of using the Panama or Suez canals, not necessarily because of their tonnage, but because of their size. These ships serve deepwater terminals handling raw materials, such as iron ore and coal. As a result, "Capesize" vessels transit via Cape Horn (South America) or the Cape of Good Hope (South Africa). Their size ranges between 80,000 and 175,000 dwt. Due to their size there are only a comparatively small number of ports around the world with the infrastructure to accommodate such vessel size. <br><br>

<u>

<b>Aframax</b></u><br> A tanker of standard size between 75,000 and 115,000 dwt. The largest tanker size in the AFRA (Average Freight Rate Assessment) tanker rate system. <br><br>

<u>

<b>Suezmax</b></u><br> This standard, which represents the limitations of the Suez Canal, has evolved. Before 1967, the Suez Canal could only accommodate tanker ships with a maximum of 80,000 dwt. The canal was closed between 1967 and 1975 because of the Israel - Arab conflict. Once it reopened in 1975, the Suezmax capacity went to 150,000 dwt. An enlargement to enable the canal to accommodate 200,000 dwt tankers is being considered. <br><br>

<u>

<b>VLCC</b></u><br> Very Large Crude Carriers, 150,000 to 320,00 dwt in size. They offer a good flexibility for using terminals since many can accommodate their draft. They are used in ports that have depth limitations, mainly around the Mediterranean, West Africa and the North Sea. They can be ballasted through the Suez Canal. <br><br>

<b><u>ULCC</u></b> Ultra Large Crude Carriers, 300,000 to 550,000 dwt in size. Used for carrying crude oil on long haul routes from the Persian Gulf to Europe, America and East Asia, via the Cape of Good Hope or the Strait of Malacca. The enormous size of these vessels require custom built terminals.
