<p class="tit_nar_cuadro1"><u><b><font face="Verdana" color="#008000">Types of 
Fumigants</font></b></u></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><strong><font size="2">1. Methyl Bromide (Bromomethane):&nbsp;</font></strong><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Methyl Bromide, at normal temperature, is a colourless gas 3.27 times heavier 
than air. The pure gas has a faintly sweet smell but it normally has a marker 
added for warning which causes watering of the eyes.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is widespread international concern over Methyl Bromide because of its 
properties as a category one ozone depletant under the Montreal Protocol of 
1992. Not withstanding its abilities as a fumigant there is a mounting consensus 
that a more suitable substance must be found by the end of the century. Methyl 
Bromide is highly toxic to mammals and is the most widely used fumigant for 
timber, agricultural products, empty containers, foodstuffs, seeds and plants. 
In particular Australian quarantine clearance by AQIS requires this method which 
includes fumigation against :</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Weeds and organisms within soil and compost, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Insects and mites, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Infestation in fresh fruit, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Within nursery stocks of plants. <br>
</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Effect on foodstuffs: After fumigation the bulk of methyl bromide is removed 
by aeration although there may be small residues. There can on occasion be a 
chemical reaction with certain food products if some absorption takes place.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Methyl Bromide is absorbed by oils, fats and finely ground materials. It can 
also react with materials containing sulphur to cause discoloration or odour. 
The following materials are among those which should not normally be fumigated 
by Methyl Bromide.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Butter, lard, fats, avocado, soybean flour, flours and baking powders,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Bone meal, charcoal and cinder blocks, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Furs, felts, horsehair, pillows, rugs and papers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Iodised salt,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Leather goods and photographic chemicals (excluding film).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Photographic prints, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Rubber goods,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Woollen goods
</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Health Warning : Exposure to Methyl Bromide has in the past resulted in a 
number of deaths. A particular danger is that signs of poisoning may be delayed 
for several hours following exposure to the gas. There is no significant 
antidote and the human body can absorb it by inhalation and via the skin.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Headache, dizziness, eye irritation, coughing, nausea, abdominal pains and 
numbness of the feet are early indications of poisoning.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Methyl Bromide is usually administered from approved cylinders or cans. It is 
important to stress the use of the correct protective clothing during 
fumigation.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Guideline quantities : For ANZ destinations - 5.0 lbs per 1000 cft or 80 gms/cbm 
For USA destinations - 4.5 lbs per 1000 cft or 72 gms/cbm For other 
destinations- 3.0 lbs per 1000 cft or 48 gms/cbm</font></p>
<p align="justify"><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. Phosphine:</font></strong></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Phosphine used for fumigation purposes is usually produced by the reaction of 
atmospheric moisture with slow release formulations containing aluminium or 
magnesium phosphide.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Phosphine is highly toxic although it requires a relatively high temperature 
and long exposure period to be effective. Under normal conditions Phosphine is a 
gas and is colourless and odourless. A fishy or garlic-like smell may be evident 
due to impurities.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A significant fire/explosion risk associated with phosphine is reduced by 
using metal phosphides specially prepared for fumigation purposes. Care must be 
taken during use to isolate any electrical connection (switches can be covered 
in paraffin wax) and any sources of ignition must be removed.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Phosphine is used for fumigating a wide band of insects and pests. It has a 
low degree of absorption by foodstuffs and penetrates well into the stored 
product.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Australian AQIS recognise its advantages over Methyl Bromide on milled and 
oily commodities such as flour, soybean flour, fishmeal, nuts and oilseeds. It 
is however not favoured for use on timber due to concerns over its ability to 
penetrate the material.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Health Warning : Very poisonous and very similar symptoms to those of Methyl 
Bromide if exposed to it. A notable effect is chest tightness and difficulty in 
breathing.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Phosphine preparations for fumigation are dispensed as :</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Powder sachets<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Degesch plates impregnated with metal phosphide formulations and sealed   prior to use <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Bag blankets or beltsMixed in cylinders with CO2 with 3% phosphine.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Tablets or pellets,&nbsp; </font></p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Guidelines on tablets : 3 tablets per CBM. The advised temperature for 
Phosphine NOT to be used below 10 deg C.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana">3. Sulphuryl Fluoride:</font></strong></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Sulphuryl Fluoride (Vikane) is used extensively in the USA to control insect 
pests in timber. It should not be used on living plants and foodstuffs. It does 
have an advantage over Methyl Bromide in that it does not have any harmful 
effects on photographic supplies, metals, electronic components, paper, leather, 
rubbers, plastics and wallpapers.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana">4. Ethylene Oxide:</font></strong></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Approval for use in foodstuffs was withdrawn by Australian authorities (AQIS) 
in 1988 due to concern over toxicity of residues formed in some foods. The 
properties of Ethylene Oxide as an insecticide and effectiveness in devitalising 
seeds make it specific to special needs such as fumigating rice straw matting.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A major drawback is the explosive qualities of Ethylene Oxide requiring it to 
be normally applied under vacuum.ç</font></p>
<p align="justify"><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana">5. Ethylene Dibromide (EDB):</font></strong></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Used for years as a treatment for fruit fly in fresh fruit and vegetables and 
agricultural needs this form of fumigation has gradually been replaced.</font></p>
